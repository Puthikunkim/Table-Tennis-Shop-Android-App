Why did we change the wishlist schema?
- Did not need all the relationships, could insert an instance of a product object into users carts or wishlists. 
- Did not make sense to have an instance of a product for a singular quantity and then determine where than 1 item
was in a cart or a wishlist. Made more sense to generalize.
